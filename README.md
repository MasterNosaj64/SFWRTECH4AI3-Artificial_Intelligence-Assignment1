-  Prepare a Python program runnable in Google's Colab.
-  Read data from "pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv".
-  Print features of the first 5 samples.
-  Calculate and print feature correlations.
-  Rescale features to the range of (0,1) and print scaled values for the first 5 samples.
-  Calculate and print correlations for rescaled data, and discuss any changes.
-  Group data by 'class' and calculate feature correlations separately for classes 0 and 1.
-  Discuss correlation differences between classes and the whole dataset.
